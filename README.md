# Introduction

A dumpster for my math aa :0

Dont expect any good repo practises this is literally a dumping ground

## Files

[LaTeXTOASCII.py](/LaTeXTOASCII/LaTeXTOASCII.py) -- Takes in _expressions.txt_ with LaTeX equations as input and outputs ASCII equations. -- useful for converting LaTeX eqn's from desmos into plaintext

Requirements:

- expressions.txt containing LaTeX equations see [expressions.txt.sample](/LaTeXTOASCII/expressions.txt.sample)
- pylatexenc `pip install pylatexenc`

[CONVERTERv0.py](/CONVERTER/CONVERTERv0.py) -- takes in _input.txt_ with ASCII equations and filters out implicit equations into _badeqn.txt_ and the rest into _goodeqn.txt_

## Roadmap

- Add conversion support for non-implicit graphs in [CONVERTERv0.py](/CONVERTER/CONVERTERv0.py)
- Add support for the rest of the graphs.

For now check out <https://tiny.cc/mathprojconverter/> by my senior although it is not as robust
