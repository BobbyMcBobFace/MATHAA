# Introduction
A dumpster for my math aa
Dont expect any good repo practises this is literally a dumping ground

## Files

[LaTeXTOASCII.py](/LaTeXTOASCII.py) -- Takes in _expressions.txt_ with LaTeX equations as input and outputs ASCII equations. -- useful for converting LaTeX eqn's from desmos into plaintext
Requirements: 
- expressions.txt containing LaTeX equations see [expressions.txt.sample](/expressions.txt.sample)
- pylatexenc `pip install pylatexenc` 

TIBasicConverter.py -- WIP 

For now check out tiny.cc/mathprojconverter by my friend although it is not as robust
